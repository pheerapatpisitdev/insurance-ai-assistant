/**
 * What the app is called once it is saved to a phone's home screen.
 *
 * Agents work from a phone, and a page saved without this gets the URL as its name and a
 * screenshot as its icon. `short_name` is what actually appears under the icon — anything
 * past about twelve characters is cut with an ellipsis, so it is the shortest name that is
 * still the right one rather than a truncation of the long one.
 *
 * `start_url` is "/" and not the chat's own path because the chat is what "/" serves; a
 * saved app that opened on a deeper page would be one the agency could not later move.
 *
 * The icon is the same file the browser tab uses. `purpose: "any"` and not "maskable":
 * Android crops a maskable icon to whatever shape the launcher uses, and this mark is tall —
 * a circle mask would take the top and bottom off the N.
