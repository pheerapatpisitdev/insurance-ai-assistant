/**
 * Every page of Studio in one frame: Studio's own menu in place of the application's, and the
 * content palette. Pressing Studio in the main menu lands somewhere of its own (owner,
 * 2026-09-27) — its pages down the side, "กลับระบบหลัก" the one way out. The pages under it
 * draw only their own content, so the menu stays put while the next page loads (loading.tsx).
 *
 * /maryjane draws the workbench without any of this — the owner asked for a page with nothing
 * else on it — so it imports StudioPage directly, keeps the old tab row (SubNav), and never
 * passes through here.
