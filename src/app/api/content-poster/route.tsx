/**
 * A content piece's poster, drawn — Thai set by a real font rather than by an image model.
 *
 * The owner's Maryjane project draws its posters this way (satori and resvg) because image
 * models mangle Thai: vowels float off their consonants and tone marks land on the wrong
 * letter. The faces are the quote card's IBM Plex Sans Thai; the drawing is satori 0.33 rather
 * than next/og, for the reason poster-png.ts gives.
 *
 * Everything the poster says is in the URL, so the picture costs nothing but CPU, an <img>
 * can show it, and a link can download it. The same words are checked for figures and for
 * Facebook's rules on the page before anyone downloads anything.
