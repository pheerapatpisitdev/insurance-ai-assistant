 * Routes are case-sensitive, and the plans are not written the way their routes are.

 * "iShield" is how the company spells it — on the proposal, in the adverts, in the page's
 * own title — so /iShield is what an agent types from memory and what a customer copies off
 * something printed. It answered 404, which is not a thing a landing page for an advert may
 * do. Anything with a capital in it is sent to the all-lowercase path instead.
 *
 * This is a redirect rather than a rule in next.config.ts because `redirects()` matches its
 * source without regard to case: a rule listing "/iShield" also catches "/ishield", and the
 * real page redirects to itself forever. Here the path is only rewritten when it actually
 * differs from its lowercase form, so a page that is already right is never touched.
