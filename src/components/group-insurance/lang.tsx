/**
 * Which language the page is in, and the two functions that follow from it.
 *
 * A context rather than props because the language reaches every leaf — a plan button, a
 * table stripe, the em-dash in an empty cell — and threading `t` through six levels of
 * component is how a leaf ends up hard-coding Thai.
 *
 * The choice is remembered in `localStorage` under the key the standalone tool used, so an
 * agency that has been running that tool in English keeps its setting when this replaces it.
 *
 * It is read in an effect rather than in the initial state, and that is not a style choice
 * either: this page is prerendered, the server has no `localStorage`, and seeding state from
 * it makes the first client render disagree with the server's and throws away the whole tree.
 * So the first paint is Thai — the setting nine agents in ten have — and English arrives a
 * frame later for the tenth.
