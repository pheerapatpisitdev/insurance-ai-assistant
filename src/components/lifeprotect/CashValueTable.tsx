      {/* Laid out in full rather than scrolled inside a box, which the owner asked for after
          living with the box: a table you scroll inside a page you also scroll is two
          scrolls fighting each other, and on a phone the inner one swallows the outer.

          What that costs is the thing the box was for — a sixty-four-year contract now runs
          to sixty-four rows of page, and whatever was under the table is a long way under it.

          The sideways scroll is kept only where it is needed, and that is not tidiness. CSS
          will not let a box scroll in one direction and stay open in the other: set
          `overflow-x`, and `overflow-y` becomes a scroller too, which makes the box the
          thing the sticky header sticks to — and a box as tall as its contents is one the
          header can never stick within. Measured rather than assumed: at row 25 of 50 the
          header sat 376px above the top of the screen, so from about row 12 the reader had
          six columns of numbers and nothing saying which was which.

          Past 1024px the table fits the column beside the menu, so there is no box and the
          header sticks to the page instead. Below that the box comes back, because six
          columns of `whitespace-nowrap` do not fit 375px and never will — there the headings
          still scroll away, which is the part of this not yet solved. */}
