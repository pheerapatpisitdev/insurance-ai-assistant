/**
 * The way back, on every sales page.
 *
 * Six plans have a page each and none of them had one: reaching the calculator from any of
 * them meant editing the address bar. It is fixed rather than in the flow because a reader
 * three thousand points down a benefit table is exactly who needs it, and because each hero
 * is composed to start at the top of its own page — a bar added above them would push all
 * six down by the height of a thing none of them were designed around.
 *
 * Every colour is a theme token. The six pages are not one skin: Life Protect is black and
 * gold, PLB is rose, iHealthy is warm cream. A literal picked to look right on one of them
 * would be invisible on another, which is the failure this project has had before.
 *
 * Top right, because every one of these heroes opens with its eyebrow line top left.
 *
 * The wrapper is not decoration. `globals.css` gives every direct child of `.theme-legacy`
 * `position: relative; z-index: 1` — so the grain and vignette behind the page stay behind
 * it — and that selector outranks a utility class: a link placed there is told it is fixed
 * and laid out relative anyway, which is a full-width bar across the top of all six pages.
 * The wrapper takes that rule instead, and it costs no height because its only child is
 * fixed.
 *
 * The wrapper carries no z-index of its own, because one would not be believed: a Tailwind z
 * utility ties that rule on specificity and loses to it on order. What puts this above the
 * page is being rendered after it — see the note in SalesTheme.
