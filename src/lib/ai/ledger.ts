 * of any select without saying so. On 2026-09-22 the spend card read exactly 1,000 calls at
 * ฿29.68 against a table holding 1,180 at ฿34.54 — and the budget guard, reading the same way,
 * was comparing the owner's ceiling to a figure that had stopped rising. Past a thousand
 * calls a month, which this system reached in three weeks, the budget protected nothing.
 *
 * So the sum is asked for as a sum. One line per model and task is enough for every reader:
 * the guard wants the total, the card wants who was paid and for what.
