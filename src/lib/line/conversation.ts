/**
 * One event from the LINE official account, answered — the same brains, the same session
 * store and the same report as the Page's inbox, so a customer who writes to either gets the
 * same figure and the owner sees both in one place.
 *
 * What the Messenger side has and this does not, and why:
 *
 * - No follow-up five minutes after a quotation. A follow-up is a push, every push is one of
 *   the account's 300 a month, and the owner chose not to spend them (2026-09-25).
 * - No pause when an agent types. LINE does not tell the webhook what an agent writes in the
 *   OA Manager, so there is no signal to pause on. The form's hand-over still silences the
 *   bot for good, the same as on Messenger — that is the moment a person takes over.
 * - No advertisement attribution. A LINE chat carries no referral.
