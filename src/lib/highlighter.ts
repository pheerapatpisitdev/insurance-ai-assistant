/**
 * A yellow highlighter stroke, drawn by hand rather than as a box.
 *
 * The owner asked for the look of a marker pen dragged across a figure: a slightly uneven top
 * and bottom edge, a blunt nib at each end, and a darker streak where the pen went over the
 * middle twice. A rounded rectangle in yellow reads as a UI badge; this reads as somebody's
 * pen, which is the point — it says "this is the number I want you to look at".
 *
 * The shape only, with no colour, so the one drawing can be filled on the card (which cannot
 * read a CSS variable) and masked on the page (which should read the token). It is stretched
 * to whatever it sits behind, hence `preserveAspectRatio="none"`.
