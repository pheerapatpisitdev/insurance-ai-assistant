/**
 * The assistant that answers out of this system's own knowledge, and out of nothing else.
 *
 * Two things can be asked of it and they are answered by two different machines.
 *
 * A question about money goes to `answerAny` — the same dispatcher the Messenger bot runs on,
 * which reads the message, fills what it can, asks for what it cannot, and prices through the
 * engine. Reusing it rather than calling `quote()` here is the whole point: the figure this
 * page gives and the figure the bot gives are then the same figure by construction, and the
 * trap that lies between them is not stepped in — on the life plan "ทุน 1 ล้าน" is what the
 * family receives and the sum assured behind it is half that before the booster age, a
 * distinction that doubles a premium if it is got wrong.
 *
 * A question about a rule goes to a model with every rule in the system in front of it. That
 * model is told, at length, that it may claim nothing which is not there.
