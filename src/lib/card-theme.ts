 *
 * The ground is flat white rather than a wash. A card travels as an image and is read beside
 * chat bubbles and printed on office paper; a gradient is the first thing to band in a JPEG
 * and the first thing to come out grey on a laser printer.
 *
 * Two values are the card's own rather than the page's, and both are here because a card is a
 * picture the reader cannot zoom into:
 *
 * `mute` is darker than the page's muted ink. This drawing fades some cells to 85% — the
 * ceiling row, whose figures sit in a column the age cannot buy but which are real figures all
 * the same — and the page's #5b6472 comes out of that fade at 4.26:1. At this value the faded
 * cells hold 5.1:1 and the difference at full strength is invisible.
 *
 * `accent` is the olive rather than the deck's display olive, for the same reason: a plan name
 * on a card is set small.
