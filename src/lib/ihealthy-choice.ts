 * company will not sell is walked to the nearest one it does — because all of it is the same
 * question asked at three different moments: on first paint, on a click, and on a link
 * arriving from somewhere else. Pricing lives next door in ihealthy-quote.ts; nothing here
 * quotes a premium, it only decides what there is to quote.
