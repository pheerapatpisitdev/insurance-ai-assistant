 * A video script read back as a shot list: one row per stretch of time, with what is said,

 *
 * The writer is asked for the script as prose with markers — "[3–15 วิ]" to start a stretch,
 * "(ชี้ไปที่กล้อง)" for an action, "{จอ: …}" for on-screen text (prompt.ts). Those markers are
 * what this reads; nothing here changes the stored words, so copying still gives the script
