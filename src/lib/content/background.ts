/**
 * What the image model is asked for when a poster gets a picture behind it.
 *
 * Maryjane's buildBackgroundPrompt (src/lib/ai/image-prompt.ts), cut to what this site needs.
 * Its two load-bearing rules are kept word for word in spirit: the picture has no text of any
 * kind, because every Thai word on the poster is set afterwards by a real font; and the part of
 * the frame the words will sit on is kept calm, so they can be read.
 *
 * No Thai reaches the model. Image models read Thai badly and, worse, try to draw it — a Thai
 * word in the prompt is how garbled lettering ends up in the picture. The writer's imagePrompt
 * is English by instruction; anything Thai left in it is removed, and the owner's own request,
 * which may well be Thai, is translated before it gets here.
