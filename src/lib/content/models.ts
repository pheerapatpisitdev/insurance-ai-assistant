/**
 * The models the owner may pick on /content, and nothing else.
 *
 * Chosen on 2026-09-23 from a bake-off of one Life Protect post written by six models:
 * Sonnet 5 read most like a person; GPT-5 close behind; Gemini 3.7 Flash clean and a sixth
 * of the price. GPT-5 mini wrote broken Thai and both GLMs leaked instructions into the
 * post, so they are not offered. The server takes only an id from these lists — a model
 * name sent from the browser is never passed on.
 *
 * Prices are per piece and per picture as measured then, for the estimate under the button.
 * Browser-safe: nothing here imports the AI client.
