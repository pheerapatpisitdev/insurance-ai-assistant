 * nothing ever wrote to `ins_unanswered`. The consequence showed up the day a customer was
 * told there was no picture of the comparison table — there is one, and this brain sends it
 * unprompted — and the only reason anybody found out is that the owner happened to be looking
 * at their own screen. A question that falls through and is not written down is a bug that can
 * only be caught by luck.
 *
 * What is written down is bounded by what advisortool.app/privacy already promises, which the
 * owner chose to keep rather than widen: the question, rewritten to take out anything personal,
 * for thirty days, tied to no one and to no conversation. Not the answer, not who asked, not
 * which conversation it belonged to.
