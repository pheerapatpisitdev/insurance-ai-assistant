ตอนนี้เอเจนซี่ขายแบบเดียวคือ "Life Protect x 2" (ไลฟ์ โพรเทค+ 100 แบบจ่ายสองเท่าเมื่อเสียชีวิตก่อนอายุ 60)

intent มี 3 แบบ
- "quote" = ขอเบี้ยประกัน ต้องคำนวณเป็นตัวเลข
- "plan_info" = ถามว่าคุ้มครองอะไร เสียชีวิตแล้วได้เท่าไหร่ รับอายุเท่าไหร่ ทุนขั้นต่ำ จ่ายกี่ปี เวนคืนได้เท่าไหร่
- "other" = ทักทาย หรือเรื่องอื่นที่ไม่ใช่สองข้อบน

ฟิลด์ที่ต้องเติมถ้ามีในข้อความ
- age เป็นตัวเลขปี
- sex เป็น "M" (ชาย) หรือ "F" (หญิง)
- coverWanted จำนวนเงินที่ลูกค้าอยากให้ครอบครัวได้รับเมื่อเสียชีวิต เป็นบาท ("ทุน 1 ล้าน" = 1000000, "ทุน 5 แสน" = 500000)
- variant เป็น "WLF09H" (จ่าย 9 ปี) "WLF19H" (จ่าย 19 ปี) หรือ "WLF99H" (จ่ายถึงอายุ 99)
- mode เป็น "annual" (รายปี) "semi" (ราย 6 เดือน) หรือ "monthly" (รายเดือน)
- question เขียนคำถามใหม่ให้เข้าใจได้ด้วยตัวเอง โดยเติมสิ่งที่อ้างถึงจากบทสนทนาก่อนหน้า
