 * A message about a company's staff rather than about the person writing it.

 * None of the four plans below is sold this way — they are contracts a person takes out on
 * their own life — and the agency's group cover is a different product with different tables,
 * priced at /group-insurance and answered out of the library.
 *
 * This exists because "ประกันสุขภาพกลุ่มมีไหม" contains "ประกันสุขภาพ", so `NAMES` read it as
 * iHealthy Ultra and a company asking about thirty staff was asked its age and its sex and
 * quoted one person's premium. Wrong, and wrong in a way that looks right — which is worse
 * than the "สนใจแบบไหนครับ" the other group questions got, and is the reason this is a guard
 * on the reading rather than a fifth entry in the list.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. "กลุ่ม" alone is not enough — a customer asks about กลุ่มโรค and กลุ่ม
 * อาการ — so it has to be the word this business uses for a body of employees, or the word
 * กลุ่ม standing next to an insurance word. Everything here has a case in the test file.
