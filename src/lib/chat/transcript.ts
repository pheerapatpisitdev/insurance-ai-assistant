 * What was said in a chat, kept ninety days so the daily review can learn from it.

 * The owner asked for this on 2026-09-26: the bot could not get better from a record that held
 * only counts. Three voices are kept — the customer, the bot, and the agent typing by hand in
 * the Page inbox, whose answers are the ones most worth teaching back. Contact details are taken
 * out before anything is written, with the same patterns the unanswered questions use, and the
 * person stays a one-way hash as everywhere else. advisortool.app/privacy says all of this.
 *
 * Nothing here may cost the customer an answer: a write that fails is logged and dropped.
