 * page. Somebody who had not built it could not tell from any one of them what else there
 * was — which is the second of the four things the owner asked to fix.
 *
 * The owner chose for this menu to appear on every page, including the sales pages a customer
 * reaches from an advertisement, after being told that means a customer sees CRM and API in
 * it. That decision lives here rather than in a condition: what changes with a session is
 * only the way out, because a sign-out button shown to somebody who never signed in is not a
 * preference, it is a button that does nothing.

   * menu is worn by six sales pages running from near-black to warm cream, and a literal
   * picked to look right on one of them vanishes on another — a mistake this project has
   * made twice.
   *
   * A hue is safe from that because it is never laid on the page's ground: it fills a chip
   * of its own, the chip carries white ink, and the chip's edge is drawn by the relief in
   * `globals.css` rather than by the difference between the hue and whatever is behind it.
   * What it buys is recognition — after a week the agent reaches for one of these without
   * reading the word.
   *
   * These used to be a full spectrum, one hue per item picked to lean toward the page it
   * opened. That worked when six sales pages ran from near-black to warm cream and the menu
   * was the only thing tying them together. The application is one palette now, and a
   * sixteen-colour rainbow down the side of a navy-and-sand page is the loudest thing on it.
   *
   * So they are one arc instead of a spectrum: teal at the top of the menu through the
   * palette's own navy in the middle to plum at the bottom, in the order the menu is read.
   * Nothing warm, because warm is the sand's, and the sand means something. Every chip still
   * has its own colour and its own place on the arc, every one carries white at 4.7:1 or
   * better, and the sidebar as a whole now reads as one object rather than as a paintbox.
   *
   * Assigned by position rather than by subject, so adding a link means re-cutting the arc
   * rather than choosing a colour — which is the point: no one here is picking colours.

 * The eleven sales pages, in the five kinds of cover the agency sells.
 *
 * Grouped because eleven names in one column is a list to be read through, and an agent
 * reaching for a page is not reading — they know whether the customer in front of them is
 * asking about dying, about being ill, about a hospital bill, about retiring, or about their
 * staff. The headings answer that before the names are read at all.
 *
 * A plan sits under what it is bought for, not under what it is built from. มรดกเพื่อครอบครัว
 * is a life contract with a critical-illness rider on it and iShield is a whole life policy,
 * and nobody buys either for the life cover: they buy the money that arrives on the day of a
 * diagnosis. Filing them under ประกันชีวิต would be filing them where nobody would look.
 *
 * Written out rather than generated from the plan registry, which is what the design said
 * before the two were compared: there are eight pages and six plans, `/legacy` is a way of
 * selling Life Protect rather than a plan of its own, iSmart has no page at all, and
 * `/group-insurance` is not a life plan and is not in the registry. A list generated from
 * the registry would therefore invent a link to nowhere and miss three that exist.
 *
 * Each one's hue leans toward the page it opens — copper for iShield, gold for the legacy
 * bundle, the corporate navy for group insurance — so the menu and the page an agent lands
 * on are plainly the same thing.

 * Ultra they made one column look like two conventions. The headings stay Thai because they
 * are not names: they are the question an agent is answering when they reach for a page, and
 * that question is asked in Thai.
 *
 * Family Legacy is the one name here the company did not supply. The bundle is the agency's
 * own and มรดกเพื่อครอบครัว is what it calls it, so the English is this menu's alone — which
 * is why it stops at this menu. Every page, quotation and message still says the Thai name,
