 * which are the same resolvers the other two moments go through; a second copy of the sums,
 * the defaults or the rules about which plan is sold at which age is how a link and a click
 * would come to disagree about the same page.
 *
 * A link is written by whoever is holding it, which makes `?sa=1e308` and `?plan=<script>` as
 * ordinary an input here as a mistyped age. Nothing from the query reaches the pricing
 * without being walked to an arrangement the company sells, and there is no query string at
 * all — including none — that this cannot answer with a real premium.
 *
 * It is its own file, next to the calculator rather than inside it, because the server
 * component parses the address before any of the calculator's code exists: the card is
 * correct in the HTML rather than corrected once React has started.
