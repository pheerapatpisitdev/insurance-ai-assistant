/**
 * Which model answers when the preferred one will not.
 *
 * The fallback used to be "then try everything else", in whatever order the table returned
 * it and with no regard for what the task was. The ledger shows what that costs. Over seven
 * days, 17 calls out of 550 — 3.1% — were 44.9% of the bill, because a classifier that costs
 * 0.009 baht on the small tier had fallen through to models charging 0.078 and 0.819. Three
 * calls of `copilot` on the large-tier model cost more than all 306 routing calls together.
 *
 * It is not only money. There is a monthly budget and the assistant shuts itself off when it
 * is reached, so an afternoon of silent 16x fallback is an evening of "ตอนนี้ผู้ช่วยปิด
 * ชั่วคราวครับ" to everyone who writes in — which is what the advertising was paying for.
 *
 * So the rule is a price ceiling rather than a list: keep trying, but never at a price this
 * task was never meant to cost.
