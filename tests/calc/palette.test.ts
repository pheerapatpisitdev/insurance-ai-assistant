/**
 * The palette is the only place a colour is decided, and this is what says so.
 *
 * Every colour in this application was re-pointed at one set of `--bot-*` tokens in
 * globals.css, lifted from a Bank of Thailand deck. Nothing enforces that at the type level:
 * `bg-slate-50` compiles, renders, and looks almost right, which is exactly why one would
 * survive a review. A year of those and the palette is back to being a suggestion.
 *
 * So two things are checked here. That no component reaches past the tokens for a colour, and
 * that the tokens themselves still clear the contrast the palette was built to clear — the
 * derived ones exist only for that reason, and a well-meant nudge toward the deck's own
 * values would quietly undo them.
